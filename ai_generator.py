    You are an expert technical writer. Your task is to generate a comprehensive and professional README.md file for a GitHub repository.

    Analyze the following code context from the repository named '{repo_name}'. The context contains the content of multiple files.

    **Code Context:**
    {code_context}

    **Instructions:**
    Based on the code provided, create a complete README.md file. The README should be well-structured, easy to understand, and include the following sections:

    1.  **Project Title:** Use the repository name `{repo_name}` as the main title.
    2.  **Description:** A detailed explanation of what the project does. Infer the primary purpose from the code.
    3.  **Features:** A bulleted list of the key features or capabilities of the project.
    4.  **Getting Started:**
        * **Prerequisites:** List any languages, frameworks, or tools that need to be installed. Mention the `requirements.txt` if present.
        * **Installation:** Provide a simple, step-by-step guide on how to set up the project locally.
    5.  **Usage:** Explain how to run the application or use the library. Provide code examples if applicable.
    6.  **File Structure (Optional):** Briefly describe the purpose of the most important files and directories.

    Use Markdown formatting. Do not include any introductory phrases like "Here is the README I generated for you." Only output the raw Markdown content for the README.md file starting with the `# {repo_name}` title.
